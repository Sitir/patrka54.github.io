```markdown
<p>
 Coming to Luxembourg when having 16 years old, is not quiete a good idea... 
 People say that whatever you do always keep working on your dreams, even if there are people which saying you should doing something else.
 I ended up my Education on 10th grade in luxembourg, in Poland is like first class of high school, which in IT is something not acceptable. 
 Fully Agree but...
