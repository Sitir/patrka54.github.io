<p>
 Coming to Luxembourg when having 16 years old, is not quiete a good idea... <br>
 People say that whatever you do always keep working on your dreams, even if there are people which saying you should doing something else.<br>
 I ended up my Education on 10th grade in luxembourg, in Poland is like first class of high school, which in IT is something not acceptable. <br>
 Fully agree but...<br>
 I have done night courses, but for the day I was study algorithms, data structures, programming(mostly by typing simply programs),Operating Systems. Web Devlopemnts or Mobile mostly hybrid but you have to know how android or iOS works to find the issue of the plugin in the code or the source code of the tool.<br>
